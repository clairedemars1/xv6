Project 1
Due 1/30/2018

Changes Made:
	procinfo.h: defined a struct to store proc info
	proc.c: implementation, based on procdump
	sysproc.c: "sys_" version, calling argptr
	syscall.c syscall.h: regular syscall setup
	testgetprocsinfo.c: test code

Overhead:
	The new syscall, getprocsinfo, does not increase memory/space overhead
	significantly, because it uses a data structure that
	already existed (ptable), allocates a limited amount of memory
	(an array of 64 new structs) using existing methods (argptr() calls).
	and uses the same setup strategies as the previously existing system
	calls.
