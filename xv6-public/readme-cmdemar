Project 2
Due 2/13/2018

Testing code: 

	there are two executables
		test_null_deref
		test for the shared pages
		
	tests don't all work: 
		before I changed copyuvm, all test cases except the last worked
		I think copyuvm caused the kfree errors present now,
		so probably I'm copying the memory wrong when forking and causing a double free
		but I couldn't isolate the error source
		(tried: wrapping each possible kfree in print statements; using 
		dbg mode- but couldn't get it to work) 


Changes Made:

	Nullptr Exceptions
	- Makefile: changed entry point for all user executables 
	(-Ttext flag argument)
	- exec.c (exec function) : added guard page at bottom of user memory
	- syscall.c (argptr function) checked that the requested access 
	address was not in the nullptr guard page
	
	Shared Pages
	- syscall setup - syscall.h, syscall.c usys.S, user.h
	- params.h defined number of shared pages allowed (NSH)
	- proc.h: made global_shared_pages[NSH]. 
	- vm.c: Made process-specific shared_pages[NSH] in proc struct
	- proc.c:  (allocproc function) initialized process's shared_pages
			(exit function) decrement reference count when a process exits, if reference count is 0, kfree the physical memory
	- defs.h and proc.c added a param to copyuvm so it took a pointer to the new proc, 
	so could let the new proc know it had shared pages, if applicable
	- vm.c (deallocuvm function) don't let it double free shared memory
