Project 2
Due 2/13/2018

Changes Made:


Plan of attack:

null ptr exceptions
1. move code from page 0 to page 1, and check usertests still work
2. find code that generates an error for somethign similar to dereferencing null ptr ( exec function )
3. find who handles the dereferencing of memory pointers
4. make #3 generate an error 

shared memory



Files considered
- userinit in proc.c (haha: 0 address)
- 3 0s in Makefile
- setupkvm in test.c (probably not relevant)
- exec function 
- initcode.S changed a number in exec
