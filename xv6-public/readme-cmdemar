Advanced OS
Project 3
Due 3/6/2018


Changes Made:
	- sycall setup: user.h, syscall.h, syscall.c, sysproc.c, defs.h, proc.c
	- syscall implementation: proc.c
	- thread_lib.h: in thread_create() allocating the stack (and calling clone) and in thread_join() freeing the stack (and calling join). Also, user locks.
	- undo check for 0 in argptr() (since we need to pass NULL to system call clone via the producer function)
	- kernel locks: The problem we talked about came back. In growproc(), there's a var you can toggle to see it.
	- clone and join are in proc.c
	- I changed fork and clone to update thread-specific proc info after calling allocproc
