- make github repo, and go in and mark the chagnes made in usertests.c, sysfile.c, syscall.h, syscall.c

- make a .h file defining the new struct, include it in usertests and sysfile.c

- get new changes to compile

Questions
Q: why are there two verison of each sys call? eg sys_wait() and wait()
if the sys one is the "in-house, available to system code" and the other the "for users" one, then why does sys_wait() call wait() and not vice versa! (However, sys_chdir does not call chdir)

Q2
why did they make two versions of printf!!!! C doesn't like it if both used in same file

Q3
we're using c to make an os, but doesn't c have a bunch of functions in a library, that assume the existence of an os. Circular? eg printf in the stdio prints to device, by calling os functions. Summary of question: how does c print stuff to terminal screen. 
I guess OS functions must not rely on those parts of C, since those parts of C rely on OS functions

Q4
functions in user.h, where are they defined?! i can't find it eg sleep(int and open(char*
